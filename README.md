# Note-taking-StarWarsApp
This Project has Two Sections 
  1->First Section is Simple CRUD operations on Notes. By this it means you can edit, read , creat and delete your own notes
     Node and Express are used in the Back-End with react as the Front-End. MongoDB is the Database Used
  2-> Second Section is star wars character look Up using the provided SWAPI. User has to type the character name and the website will return all the relevant details of the character.
      This is mainly accomplished by react in the front end

# Folder Structure
It is simple! we have two folders Client and Server and a ReadMe which you are currently reading.
Server -> all the necessary Routes/APIs are built here which will be consumed by the client
Client -> gets data from the back end APIs and presents it to the end user
Databaase Used -> MongoDB
