# Note-taking-StarWarsApp
This Project has Two Sections 
  
  #First Section 
  is Simple CRUD operations on Notes. By this, it means you can edit, read, create and delete your own notes.
     Node and Express for defining routes/APIs are used in the Back-End with react as the Front-End. MongoDB is the Database Used.
  #Second Section 
  is a star wars character look Up using the provided SWAPI. The user has to type the character name and the website will return all the relevant details of the character.
      This is mainly accomplished by React in the front end
  #Important Note -> In the second section where it says "Click to get all the star wars characters" will return the results a bit slowly. Give it some seconds to get all the records   

# Folder Structure
It is simple! we have two folders Client and Server and a ReadMe which you are currently reading.
Server -> all the necessary Routes/APIs are built here which will be consumed by the client
Client -> gets data from the back end APIs and presents it to the end user
Databaase Used -> MongoDB
